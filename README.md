# Disaster Evacuation Simulation Tool 

This project is a web-based agent-based simulation tool designed to model and visualize evacuation scenarios during natural disasters, with an initial focus on flood events. Built using **Three.js**, it integrates **geospatial data** from OpenStreetMap and ESA's Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to simulate real-world terrains and dynamic human behavior under emergency conditions.


## Installation

To run the simulation tool locally:

### 1. Install Node.js

Download and install the latest **LTS** version of Node.js from the official website:
